# ssense-arena
Right now, the way this uses Puppeteer to log into SSense, navigate to your wishlist, and then output the list of links into a format that mirrors Safari's bookmark export file structure which can then be imported into are.na. I eventually would like to use the are.na API to take the output from Puppeteer and inject the links into a channel without having to manually upload the bookmark-style file.
